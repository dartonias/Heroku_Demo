<h1>Reddit Censorship</h1>
<p>A small project to examine posts that are deleted from certain active subreddits.
Monitored posts are those currently being watched, while censored posts are those that have been removed by a subreddit.
Note, we do not look at the mechanism for such removals, whether automatic or manually by a moderator.</p>
<p>Posts are scraped every hour from <code>reddit.com/r/&lt;subreddit&gt;/new</code>.
Once posts are one day old, we check if they have been deleted from the subreddit; if they have we add them to the censored category.
Deletion is checked by a search request, as posts removed from a subreddit can still be reached by their original URL, but no longer show up in searches.</p>

<p>
The subreddits chosen are simply those that I suspect remove enough posts to gather interesting data on the problem.
</p>

<p>Valid modifiers as a query in the URL are the following:
<table class="args">
<tr><td><code>search</code></td><td>(str) limits results that contain the substring in the title</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>regexp</code></td><td>(str) limits results that contain the regular expression in the title, will override search command</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>subreddit</code></td><td>(str) limits results that contain the substring in the subreddit name</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>limit</code></td><td>(int) limits the number of entries returned</td></tr>
</table>
